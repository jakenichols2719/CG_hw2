Homework 2: Objects
James Nichols

Goal: I've always done object-oriented programming, so I want to implement
that approach with OpenGL to create a very basic scene. I will include more of
my thoughts throughout development in notes.txt so as to not clog up the README.

Controls:
0: Reset scene
1, 2, 3: Switch camera view
1: First-person perspective
2: Overhead perspective
3: Overhead orthogonal

W, A, S, D (Mode 1): Move camera
Arrow Keys (All Modes): Rotate camera

Total Time: 20-25 hrs
